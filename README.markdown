## Setup Instructions

Want to run or contribute to the Bee's Treats website? Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (for server-side processing, e.g., form handling)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, for local development tools like `live-server`)
- A web server (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP, or a hosting provider for PHP)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bees-treats.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd bees-treats
   ```
3. Set up a local server:
   - For PHP, use XAMPP/MAMP or a similar tool to serve the site. Place the project folder in the server’s `htdocs` (XAMPP) or equivalent directory.
   - Alternatively, for static file testing, use:
     ```bash
     npx live-server
     ```
4. If using dependencies (e.g., for JavaScript), install them:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Access the site:
   - Local PHP server: Open `http://localhost/bees-treats` in your browser.
   - Live-server: Open `http://localhost:8080`.

### Notes
- Ensure PHP is configured to handle the WhatsApp form submission (check `order.php` or related files for setup).
- The gallery images (e.g., in `images/BG_1.jpg`) should be included in the `images/` folder.
- The project is on track for completion by **May 31, 2025**, with all features fully functional and deployed.
